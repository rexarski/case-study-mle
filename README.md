## TODO

- [ ] Pick ioslides/slidy/real.js as the rmarkdown presentation format.
- [ ] Possible extensions: 
  - [ ] from SLR to MLR, to GLM?
  - [ ] maybe we can introduce some packages like [`mle`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats4/html/mle.html) which specifies doing estimation calculation?
