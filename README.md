## TODO

- [x] Make a `{xaringan}` slide.
- [x] Mathematical proof ➡️ LaTeX.
- [x Possible extensions: 
  - [x] from SLR to MLR, to GLM?
  - ~~maybe we can introduce some packages like [`mle`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats4/html/mle.html) which specifies doing estimation calculation?~~
